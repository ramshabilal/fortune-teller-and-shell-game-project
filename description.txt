Game Project 1

Deliverables
 Submit one source file.
 Each problem should be in its own function.
 Upload the questions as a separate text file.

Focus
Program flow, use of a simple if statement, random numbers

Fortune Teller
Your assignment is to implement a simulated &quot;Fortune Teller&quot;. Prompt the user to ask the question
that they want answered. You will then give them one of 6 answers based on random selection. Note:
you will need to use an if statement to complete this problem.
Possible answers are: &quot;Not in your lifetime&quot;, &quot;Maybe next week&quot;, &quot;Yes!&quot;, etc.
Example Output:
What is your burning question? &gt; Will I get rich?
The fortune teller has answered: Maybe next week

Shell Game

Ask the user which &quot;shell&quot; contains the ball. Possible choices are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
The user should be given two tries to find it. Note: you may assume the input is in a valid format and
range (in this case you can assume that the user enters a number between 1 and 5).
Example Output:
Where is the shell? Choose box 1 - 5 &gt; 2
That is incorrect.
You may try again.

Where is the shell? Choose box 1 - 5 &gt; 4
Correct!
